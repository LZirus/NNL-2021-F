This paper documents the entire process of creating a machine learning model,
that is capable to determine, whether a person is wearing a mask or not, on
basis of an image of that person. The project includes the creation of an
annotation software used to edit and pre-process the used dataset as well as the
implementation, training and testing of the model itself.
